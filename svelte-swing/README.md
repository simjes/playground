# Svelte-swing

##### Dev notes

The third party API does not support `CORS`, so I am using `Netlify functions` and [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/). Running development with `Netlify Dev` will automatically get the environment variables from the site configuration in `Netlify`. See `.env.example` for required environment variables.
